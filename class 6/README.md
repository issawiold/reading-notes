## Java OO Tutorial

why are we here again ? oh yes inheritence .
inheritence is the ability to pass the constrctors , methods , and variables of declared within one class to another allowing to uphold the DRY rule .

### What is the difference between an Object and a Class in Java?

I think we've already answered this question before but ok 
an object is an instance of a class.
whicle a class is the blueprint for an object.
### Explain to a non-technical friend the concept of inheritance in Java ?

inheritence is like creating a family of classes. There's a main class with common traits, and other classes inherit those traits. It's like creating the common ground and building upon existing features, so you don't have to repeat yourself.afterwards each class can add its own unique abilities. Just like real animals share traits but have their own special things, Java inheritence helps organize and reuse code smartly.

## Java Static Keyword

### Static methods are also called what? Why?

class methods since you don't need to initiate a new instance of them to access them but access them by calling the class name dot the method name.

### How can you access a variable of a class without instantiating an object from that class?

by calling the name of the class dot name of the method .

## Java Singleton Class

### What is a Design Pattern? Describe one or two with analogies from your previous work experience.
Design patterns provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenario.
people in rainy areas tilt their roofs to let rainwater flow down and prevent water from pooling.
or people in hot areas cover their dry leafs roofs with mud to prevent fire from happening
### What is a Singleton?
In Java, Singleton is a design pattern that ensures that a class can only have one object. 
there is a method inside the singleton which insures that only one instance of that object will exist by checking if the value of that object is null or not , if it's null it'll initiate a new one , if not it will return the values that are already in that object
