# optimal binary search tree

an optimal binary search tree is a binary search tree that keeps the number of nodes on each side equal or only have one more node on one side when it's commpared with the other .

everytime a new element is added to the tree the placement of many of the elements in that tree would change to keep the structure optimal .

The OBST is a useful data structure in applications where the keys have different probabilities of being searched for. It can be used to improve the efficiency of searching and retrieval operations in databases, compilers, and other computer programs.

as you can always know whare a certain element is going to be and would always give you the shortest bath to reach an element with a certain value when going blind and can't tell the exact index of that element
