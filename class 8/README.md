### Are there any projects that youâ€™ve built during your time at Code Fellows (or prior) which could benefit from applying the Rule of Three to DRY up your code?
none so far , maybe when I started coding , I mean I learnt coding back when I was first year engineering student c++/c# and that was like ages ago 
### Explain how you would dry up your code if you noticed that you are repeating the same logic in multiple places?
put that code insside a function and call that function , but that's only one way it might not work for everyone 
### Describe some benefits of releasing an MVP of a product.
- allows you to check what customers want and need in your product .
- allow you to release the product as fast as possible.
- limit unnessessery risks.
- allow you to test if the product can be made
- check if it's affordable to targeted people
- lessen the hour that engineers need to work on an idea
### What are some potential pitfalls of waiting until a product is fully mature to release it.
- bad customers response to the launch 
- customers not being able to afford the unite price of the product
- product not working as it should have
- wasted hours of engineering only to reach the conclusion that such product can't be made
